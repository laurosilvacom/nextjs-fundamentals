# Understanding Next.js Project Structure

In a Next.js project, the key element to comprehend is the `appDir`. The App Router in Next.js paves the way for constructing applications utilizing the most recent features of React, including Server Components, Suspense Streaming, and Server Actions.

## Files at the Root Level

Files located at the root level of your project play a crucial role in configuring your application, managing dependencies, executing middleware, incorporating monitoring tools, and setting up environment variables. Here are some of these files:

- `next.config.js`: Serves as the configuration file for your Next.js project.
- `package.json`: Holds the project's dependencies and scripts.
- `.env files`: Used for defining environment variables.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies the files and folders that should be ignored by Git.
- `next-env.d.ts`: Acts as the TypeScript declaration file for Next.js.
- `tsconfig.json`: Serves as the configuration file for TypeScript.
- `jsconfig.json`: Acts as the configuration file for JavaScript.

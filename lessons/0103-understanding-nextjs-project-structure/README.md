# Understanding Next.js Project Structure

In a Next.js project, the key element to comprehend is the `appDir`. The App Router in Next.js paves the way for constructing applications utilizing the most recent features of React, including Server Components, Suspense Streaming, and Server Actions.

## Files at the Root Level

Files located at the root level of your project play a crucial role in configuring your application, managing dependencies, executing middleware, incorporating monitoring tools, and setting up environment variables. Here are some of these files:

- `next.config.js`: Serves as the configuration file for your Next.js project.
- `package.json`: Holds the project's dependencies and scripts.
- `.env files`: Used for defining environment variables.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies the files and folders that should be ignored by Git.
- `next-env.d.ts`: Acts as the TypeScript declaration file for Next.js.
- `tsconfig.json`: Serves as the configuration file for TypeScript.
- `jsconfig.json`: Acts as the configuration file for JavaScript.

## Using Top-Level Folders for Organization

Top-level folders, particularly the src directory, can be used to structure your application. Next.js endorses the widespread practice of housing application code within the src directory. This method separates the application code from the project configuration files, which are typically located at the project's root. This separation is favored by certain developers and teams.

To utilize the `src` directory, relocate the app Router folder or pages Router folder to `src/app` or `src/pages` respectively.

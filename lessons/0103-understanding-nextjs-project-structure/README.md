# Understanding Next.js Project Structure

- `node_modules`: This directory is where npm (or your package manager) stores the packages that your project depends on. It's created when you run `npm install` or `pnpm install`.

- `public` folder: This directory is used by Next.js to serve static assets like images, fonts, and scripts. Files inside this directory can be referenced in the codebase with a root-relative URL.

- `src` folder: This is typically where you put all your source code. It usually contains subdirectories like `pages`, `components`, `styles`, etc.

- `.eslintrc.json`: This is the configuration file for ESLint, a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript. It's where you define your own linting rules, parser options, and more.

- `.gitignore`: This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files already tracked by Git are not affected.

- `next-env.d.ts`: This is a TypeScript declaration file for Next.js. It ensures that Next.js types are picked up by the TypeScript compiler.

- `next.config.mjs`: Similar to `next.config.js`, it's the configuration file for your Next.js project but written as an ES module.

- `package-lock.json`: This is an automatically generated file that is meant to lock down the versions of a project's dependencies thus ensuring that you, your colleagues, or your CI/CD setup all install exactly the same dependencies.

- `package.json`: This file holds various metadata relevant to the project. It includes the project's dependencies, scripts, version, license information, etc.

- `postcss.config.mjs`: This is the configuration file for PostCSS, a tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript. It's where you define the PostCSS plugins you want to use.

- `README.md`: This file typically contains information about the project, such as a description, installation instructions, usage examples, and more.

- `tailwind.config.ts`: This is the configuration file for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. It allows you to customize your design system (colors, spacing, typography etc.), configure variants, plugins, and more.

- `tsconfig.json`: This file is used to configure the TypeScript compiler options for your project.
